      The Cataclysm meant the end of so many human lives.<br>
      We cannot let our response to it mean the end to our humanity. <br>
      <strong>Every struggle for human rights is fundamentally <br>
      a struggle for self-determination</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Like water, Love between men, Love between women, <br>
      love between humans flows where it will,<br>
      all attempts to control it are born of folly and destined to fail. <br>
      <strong>All of humanity has the right to seek love wherever <br>
      love resides and in whatever form it takes</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      The future of this fragile world we've inherited lies in creating <br>
      a sensible, sustainable social order, Eugenics masquerading as <br> 
      paternal good will, can only finish what the cataclysm started. <br>
      <strong>Sexual reproduction has no role to play in defining the social order</strong>      
    </p>
    <p>
      Families and communities are of our own making and reflect our <br>
      values, not those of government. Our lives, bodies and love are <br> 
      ours to do with as we please, regardless of the effect of those <br>
      choices on society or — yes — even the future of the human race. <br>
      <strong>The means of reproduction are ours and they <br>
      are not the business of the government</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Are we to take them at their word when the government <br>
      assures us it's our patriotic duty to procreate? <br>
      “For the good of Our Nation” has been the start of <br>
      the battle cry of tyrants throughout history. <br>
      <strong>Every beginning points the way down the path to the <br>
      government’s true interest in the welfare of its fertile citizens</strong>    
    </p>
    <p>
      The spirit, the strength and the sanctity of the human <br>
      race lies in its dignity and impulse to charity, <br>
      Those who worship at the altar of their own power <br>
      worship the falsest god of them all <br>
      <strong>Regard these tenets as the egg from which the truth will be born</strong>
